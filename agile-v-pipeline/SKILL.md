# Instructions

Orchestration pipeline for Agile V. Requires **agile-v-core** loaded first.

## Pipeline

```
Stage 1: Requirements -> Stage 2: Validation -> [Human Gate 1] -> Stage 3: Synthesis (Build Agent || Test Designer) -> Stage 4: Verification -> [Human Gate 2] -> Stage 5: Acceptance
Compliance Auditor observes all stages.
```

## Handoffs

1. Req Architect emits REQUIREMENTS.md -> Logic Gatekeeper reads.
2. Gatekeeper -> Gate 1 (Evidence Summary, Human approves).
3. Build Agent || Test Designer from REQUIREMENTS.md, no shared context.
4. Build Manifest + Test Cases -> Red Team Verifier.
5. Validation Summary -> Gate 2.

## Wave Execution

Dependency analysis -> Wave assignment (no-deps = Wave 1) -> Parallel within waves (fresh context each) -> Sequential across waves -> Prefer vertical slices (feature > layer).

## Checkpoint Types

| Type | Action |
|------|--------|
| Auto | Proceed |
| Human-Verify | Confirm output |
| Human-Decision | Choose alternative |
| Human-Action | Physical/external step |

All except Auto require Human Gate protocol.
