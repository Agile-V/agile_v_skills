## How to Read This Documentation

Each compliance matrix document contains:
1. **What Agile V covers** -- which skill(s) address each clause, with specific evidence
2. **What Agile V does NOT cover** -- honest gaps that require organizational action
3. **What you need to do** -- concrete steps to close each gap for your context

The [Gap Roadmap (COMP-007)](compliance/07_GAP_ROADMAP.md) consolidates all gaps into a prioritized action plan.
